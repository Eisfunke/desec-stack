Hi,

We received a request to reset the password for your deSEC account.
This may happen when someone uses the "Reset Password" function on our
web site, or when you created a new account just now that does not yet
have a password.

To ensure that the request is legitimate, we need you to confirm it
using the following link:

{{ confirmation_link }}

After your confirmation, you can provide your new password.

Stay secure,
The deSEC Team
